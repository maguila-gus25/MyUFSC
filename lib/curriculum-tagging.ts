/**
 * Curriculum data hygiene: re-tag non-discipline graduation requirements off
 * `mandatory` (issue #11).
 *
 * UFSC curriculum JSON types "Atividades Complementares" as `mandatory`, but it
 * has no class sections and no real phase — it is a graduation requirement, not
 * a schedulable discipline. Consumers (the plan generator, the visualizers) each
 * work around this with the name-based {@link isNonDisciplineRequirement} filter.
 * The cleaner fix is to correct the data at ingestion so every consumer sees the
 * right `type`; the runtime filters then become defense-in-depth, not the source
 * of truth.
 *
 * This module is a pure transform over the raw curriculum `courses` array. It
 * handles both storage shapes: the compact array
 * `[id,name,credits,workload,description,prerequisites,equivalents,type,phase]`
 * (type at index 7) and the object form (`{ type }`). It changes ONLY the `type`
 * of matched rows, is idempotent, and never mutates its input.
 *
 * NOTE: re-tagging to `optional` makes an Atividades Complementares row read as
 * an elective to `isRealElective`. `graduation.ts` and `electives.ts` check
 * {@link isNonDisciplineRequirement} first / exclude it, so the hours still
 * bucket as complementares and it is never scheduled as an optativa.
